# Film Fan

## Description

Film fan is a movie review app designed around a clean and simple user experience. We wanted to build something easy to use and nice to look at while providing functionality. It removes much of the clutter you typically get in a traditional movie review application. Working on Film Fan was a great learning experience, putting together many different concepts and technologies.
